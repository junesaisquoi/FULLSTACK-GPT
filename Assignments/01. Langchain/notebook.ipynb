      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tbsp lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 tsp ground cumin\n",
      "- 2 tsp paprika\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground turmeric\n",
      "- 1 tsp garam masala\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground coriander\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\n",
      "- 1 cup heavy cream\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Stir in the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the heavy cream and cooked chicken tikka pieces. Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\n",
