      "üëâ In the text provided, it is mentioned that Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with. However, it is also stated that Winston had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt and that it had never existed, he had invented it. This ambiguity suggests that the guilt of Aaronson and the others may not be as clear-cut as it seems.\n",

      "‚ùì Who is Julia?\n",
      "üëâ Julia is a character from George Orwell's novel \"1984.\" She is a woman who becomes romantically involved with the protagonist, Winston Smith. Their relationship is a central part of the story, as they rebel against the oppressive regime of the Party in the dystopian society depicted in the novel.\n"
